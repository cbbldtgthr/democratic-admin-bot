# Telegram Community bots
A set of telegram bots to aid administration of Telegram groups

Initial two use cases:
- A bot that anonymously posts an anoymous poll on whether to kick/mute a user.
  After 24hours the bot performs the action based on the majority vote.
- A bot that collects posts from a buy-and-sell group and posts them to a
browsable catalog.
